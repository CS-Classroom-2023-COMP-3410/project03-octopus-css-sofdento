I sent everything over to chatgpt to create a basic template for the website. I then assessed the version given by chatGPT and llisted out all the things that needed fixing. I did this back and forth for awhile, but then chatGPT kept saying that it failed to edit. Then I used the inspector tools on the page to figure out what parts of the code were doing what on the page. I was going back and forth with this, making changes, but I could not figure out how to get the quiz box to look right. So I went back to chatGPT in a rereshed new page and got some final help. I started too close to the deadline so it is not perfect, but definitely in the right direction.
